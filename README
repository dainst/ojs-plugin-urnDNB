About
-----

The DNB plugin creates URNs wich are compatible with the DNB-guidelindes. It was developed by CeDis and is not maintained by them 
anymore, since they want to replace it by a conceptual different plugin for OJS3. This repository is s slightly improved version
of that.

See the documentation in German: http://pkp.sfu.ca/wiki/index.php/URNPlugIn_Doku

The plugin is a part of the project "Functional extensions and value added services for OJS" located at the Freie Universität Berlin and founded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).
